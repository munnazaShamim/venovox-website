The authorities are not after the money trail. Combing thru a fine-tooth comb, the spotlight is now on two Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) for failing (or lacking) to perform the necessary due diligence on their startup. The general public can’t help but point their fingers at the “big C”. Corruption, defined as the abuse of power for personal gain, remains a pervasive issue in Malaysia. Its far-reaching impacts spanning across economic, political, and social systems - destabilize institutions, distort markets, and erode public trust. Due diligence, on the other hand, is a rigorous process of investigation and analysis, aimed at ensuring transparency, assessing risks, and verifying information before entering into business or financial relationships. At its core, due diligence serves to prevent fraud, mitigate risks, and uphold compliance with legal, ethical, and regulatory standards. The relationship between corruption and due diligence is vital and complex, because due diligence can serve as a crucial tool for identifying, mitigating, and ultimately preventing corrupt practices.

In Malaysia, we have stooped to a level that a police road block is just a ‘cari makan’ and not serving the true purpose. Political appointees are just Ministers’ cronies to stay in power. The list goes on. By performing comprehensive due diligence, companies and organizations can: - Identify Risk Factors: A thorough due diligence process helps identify potential corruption risks in a business or investment venture. For example, examining the ownership structures of a company or the backgrounds of key personnel can highlight connections to politically exposed persons (PEPs), known corrupt officials, or entities with histories of bribery or fraud. - Verify Legitimacy: Due diligence helps ensure that the entities or individuals you are dealing with are legitimate, compliant with relevant anti-corruption laws, and free from any criminal backgrounds that could expose your business to liability. This is especially important when entering unfamiliar or high-risk jurisdictions where corruption is endemic. - Ensure Compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws: Venovox had a full Seminar on ABAC. Do browse of publication list for the article and video. Many countries have strict anti-corruption regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or the UK Bribery Act. Through due diligence, companies can assess whether their partners, suppliers, or third-party agents are complying with these laws. Failure to conduct proper due diligence can expose organizations to fines, reputational damage, and other legal consequences."

                "content": "Due diligence is not a one-size-fits-all process; it requires a tailored approach based on the specific risks and challenges posed by a given transaction or partnership. In the context of corruption, several types of due diligence can be particularly useful: - Financial Due Diligence: Examining the financial health of a company can reveal irregularities, such as suspicious payments or unexplained transactions that could be indicative of corrupt practices. This includes reviewing financial statements, transaction records, and tax filings to ensure all business activities are legitimate and properly documented. - Legal Due Diligence: This process involves reviewing the legal standing of a company or individual, such as checking for any history of litigation related to corruption or fraud. It also includes assessing the legal compliance of partners and suppliers with anti-corruption laws and regulations. - Background Checks: A key component of due diligence is conducting background checks on potential business partners, executives, and third-party intermediaries. This may involve investigating their history, including prior criminal convictions, associations with corrupt individuals or entities, and involvement in any past corruption scandals. 1000+ Clients of Venovox can’t be wrong in engaging our services for their new hires. Stay in touch with Kelly at 012 800 8888 or kelly@venovox.com for a tailor-made program to meet your hiring need. - Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policies: A due diligence review should include an assessment of a company's internal anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies. This ensures that the company has appropriate mechanisms in place to prevent, detect, and respond to corrupt behaviour within its operations. - Third-Party Risk Assessment: Companies often rely on intermediaries, agents, or contractors to conduct business. Due diligence helps assess the risk posed by third parties by evaluating their reputation, compliance with laws, and potential connections to corrupt activities.",

Some of the risks associated with neglecting due diligence in the fight against corruption include: - Legal and Regulatory Penalties: Non-compliance with anti-corruption regulations can result in hefty fines, sanctions, and even imprisonment for key personnel. This is especially pertinent for multinational corporations operating across jurisdictions with differing corruption laws. - Reputational Damage: Corruption scandals can seriously damage an organization’s reputation, leading to the loss of customers, investors, and business partners. A tarnished reputation can take years to rebuild and may even result in the permanent loss of trust within an industry. - Financial Losses: Engaging with corrupt parties can lead to financial losses from fraud, embezzlement, or contract cancellation. Additionally, the costs associated with regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, and settlements can drain corporate resources. - Lost Business Opportunities: If a company is implicated in corrupt activities, it may be excluded from future business opportunities, partnerships, or government contracts. This can result in long-term economic damage and limited growth prospects."

Tools such as artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and blockchain technology have made it easier to assess corruption risks in real-time, analyse large sets of financial and legal data, and track the flow of funds across complex networks. Companies can now use these technologies to identify unusual patterns or transactions that could signal corrupt behaviour, allowing them to act swiftly to mitigate risks. Venovox have established our own platform codenamed VOSS. Feel free to explore at www.venovox.com. For example, AI can be used to scan and cross-reference massive amounts of public records, such as news articles, court filings, and government sanctions lists, to identify potential red flags. Blockchain, with its transparency and immutability, can be used to track financial transactions and ensure that there is no manipulation or illicit activity in the movement of funds.

The escalating expectations of customers and decreased tolerance for misconduct are creating a delicate operating environment in relation to reputation risk, making it essential for businesses to adapt effectively. Reputational risk refers to anything that can damage the way a company is perceived. It includes threats, whether true or not, that could harm the name, goodwill, or credibility of a business, ultimately impacting its revenue. Quantifying reputational risk is challenging as it comes in various forms, whether as a result of the company's own actions or through associations with third-party businesses.

Therefore, it is imperative for human resources (HR) staff to actively seek out executives with a strong reputation to bolster the public image of the organization. The professional conduct of these leaders is instrumental in helping companies establish and maintain a positive image. Additionally, it's important to recognize that suppliers or partners also carry a potential reputational risk for the organization. The reputation of a supplier can significantly impact your company's overall reputation and subsequently affect its financial standing. Collaborating with third-party suppliers, vendors, and partners from diverse geographic locations introduces various risks. Some risks, such as data breaches or bankruptcies, are readily apparent, while others, such as negative press or questionable business practices, may not be immediately evident. Since a supplier’s reputation can quickly become synonymous with your company’s reputation, it is crucial to proactively monitor third parties for any potential reputational risks that could have a direct impact on the company’s financial performance."

Risk management extends beyond just your suppliers. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct a thorough pre-screening of all employees before their onboarding. Implementing a pre-employment background check and reference verification is essential to confirm the candidate's qualifications and identify any potential concerns. However, the risk an individual may pose to the organization does not cease once they are hired. Engaging in a reputable background screening service ensures that the evaluation is unbiased and tailored to the specific industry and position.

In many industries, it’s common for jobs to be filled through referrals or word-of-mouth recommendations. A strong network serves as a resource for learning and staying updated on industry trends. Connecting with experts or peers allows you to gain new perspectives and insights, keeping you informed about innovations, best practices, and emerging technologies that could impact your career or business. Networking can play a crucial role in personal career growth. Mentors, colleagues, and industry leaders in your network can provide advice, guidance, and support, helping you make informed decisions at critical points in your career. Building relationships with people who have already navigated similar paths can significantly shorten your learning curve. Consistently showing up, offering help, and sharing your expertise with others in your network helps to build trust and establish your credibility. Over time, people come to know you as a reliable and resourceful person, making them more likely to turn to you for advice, partnerships, or recommendations. For entrepreneurs, networking is vital for expanding business opportunities. Forming connections with investors, potential clients, or collaborators can help grow your business and increase its visibility. Strong networks can also provide critical support in times of uncertainty or crisis, making your business more resilient.",

Networking doesn’t end once a connection is made. It’s important to nurture these relationships by staying in touch, offering help, and engaging with your network regularly. This can be as simple as checking in, sending helpful resources, or sharing professional updates. Online platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and industry-specific forums are powerful tools for expanding your network beyond your immediate geographic area. These platforms provide opportunities to connect with professionals globally, join discussions, and stay updated on industry news. Industry conferences, seminars, and local meetups are great opportunities to meet people face-to-face. Engaging in conversations during these events can help solidify relationships and make a lasting impression. Virtual events have also become more popular and accessible, enabling people to network remotely. One of the best ways to establish strong connections is by offering value to others first. This could be in the form of sharing knowledge, offering introductions, or supporting a project. By being helpful and resourceful, you increase the likelihood that others will be willing to help you in the future.",

If the dispute is unresolved, it may be referred to the Industrial Court for adjudication. A recent case at the Industrial Court of Malaysia, Mohd Fauzi bin Mohd Shariff vs. Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, highlights the importance of proper dismissal procedures. The claimant, a Branch Manager, was dismissed for allegedly sleeping at work. However, the court ruled that the dismissal was unreasonable and unjust, considering his good leadership and the branch’s performance under his management. The court awarded the claimant RM240,384 in compensation for wrongful dismissal. This case serves as a crucial reminder for employers that unjust dismissal can lead to costly legal disputes.",

The integration of AI technologies in HR practices has led to increased efficiency, accuracy, and fairness in hiring. Here are some key ways AI is making an impact in HR screening: Resume Screening: AI algorithms have the capability to quickly scan and filter resumes based on specific keywords, qualifications, and experience. This automation saves HR professionals considerable time and ensures that only the most relevant candidates progress to the next stage of the hiring process. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are designed to manage the entire recruitment process, from posting job vacancies to tracking candidate applications. These systems automate administrative tasks and provide real-time updates on candidate status, streamlining the hiring workflow. Candidate Matching: AI excels at analysing job descriptions and candidate profiles to identify the best matches. This technology enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the hiring process, ensuring that the right candidates are identified quickly and effectively. Interview Scheduling: AI-powered tools can automate the scheduling of interviews, coordinating the availability of candidates and interviewers. These tools send reminders and ensure smooth communication, reducing the administrative burden on HR teams. Bias Reduction: One of the significant advantages of AI in HR screening is its potential to reduce unconscious bias. By focusing on skills and qualifications rather than personal details, AI helps in making impartial hiring decisions and promoting diversity. Predictive Analytics: AI can analyse historical data to predict a candidate's success and fit within the organization. This predictive analytics capability helps HR teams make more informed and strategic hiring decisions. Onboarding: AI also plays a crucial role in the onboarding process. It can provide new hires with personalized training materials, schedules, and resources, ensuring a smooth and efficient transition into the company. AI is transforming HR task by automating routine tasks and providing data-driven insights. These advancements allow HR professionals to focus on more strategic activities, ultimately improving the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the recruitment process.",

He has also stated that they are still open to negotiations with borrowers who wish to settle their debts before court action is taken."

Although interest rate is purposefully kept low to make education accessible to all, PTPTN borrowers who have graduated from Malaysian universities pose abusive problem which has become more prevalent. Vast majority of graduates tend to postpone repayments indefinitely, citing a variety of excuses including menial pay, indifferent administration, and onerous paperwork and procedures.\n\nPTPTN defaulters are subject to several harsh penalties, intended to promote repayment and guarantee the long-term viability of the loan scheme. Firstly, travel Bans are imposed on defaulting individuals as they may not be permitted to leave the nation. Unless their outstanding loans are paid off, they will not be able to renew their passports or pass through immigration checkpoints. \nImpact on Credit Scores and Financial Access\nSecondly, defaulters' credit scores are impacted when they are reported to the Central Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS). Hence, obtaining loans, credit cards, or other financial services from banks and other financial organizations are challenging. \nLegal Actions and Wage Garnishments\nThirdly, PTPTN had always had the right to file a lawsuit against loan defaulters, which could lead to a ruling requiring the loan repayment in addition to extra legal costs. A lawsuit may also result in wage garnishment or other enforcement actions."

However, they will need to provide evidence of their financial situation, such as income statements to support their application. PTPTN will review the application and determine the new repayment terms based on the borrower’s financial capacity.\n\nTo be eligible for PTPTN loan deferment or restructuring, borrowers must meet specific criteria. Namely, borrowers with a monthly gross income of RM1,800 or below are eligible to apply for payment deferment. Another being borrowers who are not participating in the Debt Management Programme (DMP) under the Credit Counselling and Debt Management Agency (AKPK) for PTPTN loans. \nAutomatic Salary Deduction System\nPTPTN too began implementing automatic salary deductions for loan repayments from September 2015 for civil servants. This initiative was extended to other borrowers from November 2015 to ensure consistent repayments and reduce the number of defaulters. This system is still being implemented and in November 2023, PTPTN has enhanced the process by introducing the Portal Majikan Online, which allows employers to manage salary deductions digitally. This online platform simplifies the process, making it more efficient and accessible for both employers and employees.\nRepayment Discounts and Incentives\nOn March 1, 2023, PTPTN too had implemented various loan repayment discounts, which was available until May 31, 20231. This discount was part of the Budget 2023 announcement and included several categories. Namely, borrowers were offered 20% discount for full settlement of the loan, 15% discount for settling at least 50% of the total outstanding debt, with the remainder through salary deduction or scheduled direct debit repayment. Borrowers we also given 5% discount for repayments made through the myPTPTN application.",

It signifies moral responsibilities, reflecting both personal integrity and social accountability. When borrowers honour this responsibility, they are fulfilling this obligation that demonstrates personal integrity and reliability. \nEnsuring Fund Sustainability and Supporting Future Students\nIt also ensures that PTPTN can continue to provide financial assistance to future students, which helps maintain the sustainability of the fund and supports the education of others. Consistent repayment too builds trust between borrowers and lenders. It shows that the borrower is responsible and can be trusted with financial commitments, which is crucial for one’s creditworthiness.\nContribution to National Development\nBy repaying loan, one can also contribute to the broader goal of national development. Educated individuals are essential for the growth and progress of the country, and loan repayments will help sustain this cycle.\n\nEven if moral commitment to personal responsibility and societal well-being is not of paramount concern, ensuring repayment obligations will avoid negative consequences such as travel bans, credit score impacts, and legal actions for the borrower. This will not only benefit the borrower personally, but also upholds the integrity of the financial system."

Employers can assist employees by setting up automatic salary deductions, foster a culture of responsibility and accountability by encouraging employees to honour their financial commitments and collaborate with PTPTN to streamline the process of loan repayments and provide additional support to employees. \nPromoting a Culture of Financial Responsibility\nBy taking these steps, employers can help reduce the number of PTPTN loan defaulters, support their employees’ financial well-being, and contribute to the broader economic progress of Malaysia. \nConfidential Employee Loan Screening\nEmployees on the other hand may choose not to reveal their PTPTN loan commitments to their employers for several reasons. Many employees prefer to keep their financial matters private and may feel uncomfortable sharing details about their debts with their employers, fear that disclosing their PTPTN commitments could lead to negative judgments about their financial stability or responsibility. They may also be concerned that revealing financial struggles could impact their job security or career progression and that employers will view them as less reliable or capable, whilst some might feel embarrassed about having student loan debt and hide to avoid any perceived stigma. \n\nSince most employees are not aware that their employers can assist with PTPTN repayments through automatic salary deductions, employers may play a role. Conducting student loan screening (with consent from employees) during pre-employment will ease the employees’ phobias and foster an environment where employees feel comfortable discussing their financial commitments without fear of judgment. Pre-screening on student loan will also ensure that any discussions about financial matters are kept confidential to protect employees’ privacy and that the employer provides a supportive environment that cultivate a workplace culture that values and supports employees’ well-being, including their financial health. A simple screening today means employers can help employees manage their PTPTN commitments more effectively, reduce financial stress, and contribute to a more productive and engaged workforce.",

Statistics suggest that fraud risk will only increase in the coming years.\n\nTo grasp the concept of fraud risk, it's essential to understand what fraud entails. Fraud involves deliberate deception to secure something of value, typically money. Fraud is committed through false statements, misrepresentation, or dishonest conduct aimed at misleading or deceiving others. Thus, fraud risk refers to the likelihood of financial loss due to intentional deception carried out by individuals or groups, either within or outside the organization. In some instances, both internal and external perpetrators may be involved.\n\nThe earliest recorded instance of financial fraud dates back to 194 AD in the Roman Empire when a group of soldiers assassinated the emperor with the intention of auctioning off the empire's leadership to the highest bidder. However, their scheme ultimately failed.\n\nFraud can have a catastrophic impact on organizations, resulting in substantial financial losses, irreversible harm to reputation, potential legal consequences, and a decline in employee morale and trust. These factors can ultimately threaten the entity's very survival.\n\nNo organization is immune to the severe damage that fraudulent activities can inflict. Fraud can occur in organizations of all sizes, whether large or small. The effects of occupational fraud can be widespread, leading to devastating financial, reputational, and operational losses.\n\nSome common types of fraud risks include financial fraud, which encompasses activities like embezzlement, misappropriation of funds, and falsification of financial statements. Asset misappropriation involves the theft or misuse of company assets, such as skimming cash, stealing inventory, or using company property for personal gain. Corruption includes bribery, kickbacks, and conflicts of interest, where employees or executives might engage in unethical practices to gain personal benefits. Cyber fraud covers hacking, phishing, and other forms of cybercrime aimed at stealing sensitive information or funds. Fraudulent financial reporting involves manipulating financial records to present a false picture of the company's financial health. Vendor fraud entails collusion with vendors to overcharge the company or deliver substandard goods or services. Finally, employee fraud includes activities like payroll fraud, expense reimbursement fraud, and misuse of company resources."

An appropriate screening partner must provide adaptable screening packages as opposed to a one-size-fits-all model.\n\nCommon screening components include:\n\nEmployment and education verification\n\nIdentity and address checks\n\nCriminal record searches (where legally permissible)\n\nDirectorship and conflict-of-interest checks\n\nCustomization of checks according to the sensitivity of a role, seniority or industry is a good sign of service maturity.\n\nLocal Expertise with Regional Reach\n\nMalaysia-based operations combined with regional or global capability are important for organisations hiring across borders.\n\nA competent provider should:\n\nUnderstand local verification processes\n\nMaintain reliable on-ground networks.\n\nSupport cross-border checks when required.\n\nThis balance ensures accuracy without unnecessary delays.\n\nAccuracy, Methodology, and Reporting Quality\n\nDecision-makers rely on screening reports to make defensible choices. Reports must be clear, factual, and actionable.\n\nAssess providers on:\n\nSource transparency\n\nVerification methodology\n\nStructured, easy-to-read reporting formats\n\nAvoid vendors that rely heavily on automated data scraping without proper validation.\n\nTurnaround Time and Service Support\n\nAlthough speed is necessary, it should not be at the expense of accuracy. A business screening partner creates achievable deadlines and expresses himself effectively throughout the process.\n\nKey indicators include:\n\nDefined service-level agreements (SLAs)\n\nDedicated account or case support\n\nClear escalation processes\n\nConsistent communication is often as valuable as fast delivery.\n\nIndustry Experience and Risk Alignment\n\nDifferent industries face different exposure levels. Financial services, healthcare, logistics, and technology sectors require deeper due diligence than general hiring.\n\nA provider with industry-specific experience can:\n\nAnticipate risk areas\n\nRecommend appropriate screening depth.\n\nAlign checks with regulatory expectations.\n\nThis reduces gaps that generic screening solutions often miss."

Being aware of the difference is essential to HR leaders, compliance officers and hiring managers who desire to possess sound and defensible hiring practices.\n\nThis blog explains what separates these two processes, clarifies when each is most effective, and provides practical guidance for organisations p, particularly those operating in or recruiting candidates across Asia and background screening Malaysia contexts."

The outcome answers a straightforward question: \"Is the information accurate?\" Background checking does not usually involve interpretive risk analysis or in-depth evaluation beyond the verification itself.\n\nUse Cases for Background Checking\n\nPre-employment checks for new hires.\n\nContract worker or consulting engagement verification.\n\nCompliance baseline prior to onboarding.\n\nAn effective background check supports employers by eliminating basic inaccuracies before advanced risk decisions are made."

For example, senior executives, finance personnel and security-critical staff may undergo more exhaustive screening than entry-level hires.\n\nKey Features of Screening\n\nDepth and breadth: Covers multiple data sources with analytical context.\n\nRisk evaluation: Assesses potential issues that may impact business or regulatory compliance.\n\nTailored scope: Aligns with industry standards (financial, healthcare, energy) and organisational risk tolerance.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, including Malaysia, employers must meet legal and compliance expectations when conducting wide-ranging checks.

                    "question": "What usually triggers an LHDN tax audit for businesses?",
                    "answer": "LHDN audits are commonly triggered by unusual filing patterns rather than random selection. Sudden drops or spikes in revenue, consistently high expense claims, repeated losses, or inconsistencies between income tax, SST, and payroll submissions can raise flags. Late filings and frequent amendments may also increase audit likelihood."

                    "answer": "In most cases, LHDN may review records from the past five to seven years, depending on the nature of the audit and compliance history. Businesses are legally required to retain accounting records, invoices, and supporting documents for at least seven years to meet audit requirements."

Inadequate documentation, incorrect expense claims, or calculation mistakes can still lead to adjustments and penalties. However, cooperation and proper explanations may help reduce the severity of enforcement actions."

A reconciliation was skipped because the month was busy. Over time, these small gaps add up, and when tax authorities review the records, the exposure becomes clear.\n\nOne of the best ways of minimising tax risks in Malaysia is through proper bookkeeping. Not in the sense that it removes audits, but simply because it allows the businesses to be in a position to justify and provide support on their numbers when necessary. This blog will define how good bookkeeping helps avert business risks, where such risks tend to occur, and what the most practical steps are that cause the most significant difference."

When records are complete and consistent, questions are easier to answer, and issues are resolved faster."
